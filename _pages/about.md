From humble beginnings, the LTG Network is on a great journey. We are a small group of people who are passionate about gaming and content creation and we are always looking to expand our community and make it more fun for everyone. And you can join us, if you want to be a part of it.

## The first step

Since the founder LaroTayoGaming launched his channel in 2016, he wants to pursue a different avenue and created The Fellow Gamer Podcast last December of 2018. And since then, we've gathered some of our friends in gaming, and content creation to create some episodes, about gaming and some comedy in general.

But then, some of our folks at Discord servers wants to have a channel who wants to create videos about anything, from Minecraft, Valorant, Jackbox and such; and thus Taym Pers! was born in April of 2022.

Since then, LTG wants to have an independent network to create a wonderful content, and to have a community of people who are passionate about gaming itself. And that's what LTG Network is all about.

## The future

In the meantime, we are writing our story to our independent network, and we are committed to be independent and open for everyone who wants to join us on our journey.
