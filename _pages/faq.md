## About The Network

This section is about the network itself, the founder and the team behind it.

### What is the LTG Network?

LTG Network is an independent network of people who are passionate about gaming and content creation. We are always looking to expand our community and make it more fun for everyone. And you can join us, if you want to be a part of it.

### What LTG Network Stands For?

LTG Network is not just LaroTayoGaming network. LTG Network stands for:

L - **LaroTayoGaming**

T - **Taym Pers! and The Fellow Gamer Podcast**

G - **(Secret future project)**

That's the meaning of the LTG Network. It is fit right?

### Do you have any contracts, etc. on the network?

No. You don't need to sign an exclusivity deal to join the network. You can join other networks (RR, Tier) and this network at the same time. But all of our Taym Pers! or TFGP official videos / podcast are copyrighted, except your POV gameplay.

### Do you have a Discord Server?

For the whole network, yes. Click the link [here](https://discord.gg/QaCPhtcSD6) to join. You need to pass the altdentifier bot btw, to prevent alts.

### Cam I support the network?

Yes, you can. You can support the network by clicking the support icon right on top, or if we approved on Adsense, you just need to view the ad and we're good to go.

## Taym Pers! Questions

All of the Taym Pers! Questions such as same edit upload, etc.

### Why Odysee for exclusive posts?

Odysee is the best alternative to YouTube. Because you can edit the whole video, if you want to have some changes, the cryptocurrency token LBC which is â‚±1 at the time of this writing, and the ability to have a backup, and to avoid demonetization in the future. That's why we have uncensored and censored videos separate from YT and Odysee. Except for horror stuff.
