## About The Network

This section is about the network itself, the founder and the team behind it.

### What is the LTG Network?

LTG Network is an independent network of people who are passionate about gaming and content creation. We are always looking to expand our community and make it more fun for everyone. And you can join us, if you want to be a part of it.

### What LTG Network Stands For?

LTG Network is not just LaroTayoGaming network. LTG Network stands for:

L - **LaroTayoGaming**

T - **Taym Pers! and The Fellow Gamer Podcast**

G - **(Secret future project)**

That's the meaning of the LTG Network. It is fit right?

### Do you have any contracts, etc. on the network?

No. You don't need to sign an exclusivity deal to join the network. You can join other networks (RR, Tier) and this network at the same time. But all of our Taym Pers! or TFGP official videos / podcast are copyrighted, except your POV gameplay.

### Do you have a Discord Server?

For the whole network, yes. Click the link [here](https://discord.gg/QaCPhtcSD6) to join. You need to pass the altdentifier bot btw, to prevent alts.
